# Test1Code for IPP MCA0407 batch of 2018
Code to Test1 programming questions

4a.py - It prints all the natural numbers between 30 and 50 (range does not print the last value.. )
        Incrementing end to 51 solves (Not the best way to do things)
        
4b.py - Works as desired and as well for different inputs.. The only thing to ponder would be see the numbers for which the
        text "FizzBuzz" would be printed.. See test.py code 
        
test.py - Code to print those FizzBuzz values.. Basically values of a 15 table...
